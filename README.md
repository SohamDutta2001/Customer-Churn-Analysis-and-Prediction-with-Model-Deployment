# Customer-Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction-with-Model-Deployment
To predict customer churn and implement proactive retention strategies, we developed a machine learning model using data cleaning, analysis, and algorithms. We also employed dimensionality reduction techniques and upsampling techniques to enhance performance and deployed the model successfully.

# Classifier Used
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier

# Procedure
* Detailed EDA including univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, data cleaning and feature selection.
* Different classifier model fittied and accuracy checked for each method.
* Final Deployment of the model using flask.
